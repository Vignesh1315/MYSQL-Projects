# World Life Expectancy - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores life expectancy trends worldwide, examining various socio-economic and health-related factors that may influence longevity across different countries. Using SQL queries on the `world_life_expectancy` dataset, key insights are drawn about life expectancy patterns in relation to factors like GDP, BMI, and mortality rates.

## Project Overview

The dataset is analyzed with a series of SQL queries to gain insights into:
1. **Life Expectancy Trends**: Understanding how life expectancy has evolved over 15 years across different countries.
2. **GDP and Life Expectancy**: Assessing the relationship between economic status (GDP) and average life expectancy.
3. **Health Factors**: Analyzing other health-related metrics, such as BMI and adult mortality, and their potential impact on life expectancy.
4. **Country Status**: Exploring life expectancy differences based on country status (developed vs. developing).
5. **Rolling Mortality Analysis**: Investigating the rolling total of adult mortality over time in specific countries.

## Key SQL Queries and Insights

- **Life Expectancy Increase Over Time**: Determines the growth in life expectancy over a span of 15 years for each country, highlighting significant improvements and identifying countries with the greatest changes.
- **Yearly Average Life Expectancy**: Shows the global average life expectancy for each year, allowing for trend analysis over time.
- **Economic Influence on Life Expectancy**: Splits countries into high-GDP and low-GDP categories and computes the average life expectancy within each group to evaluate the impact of wealth on longevity.
- **Life Expectancy by Country Status**: Compares life expectancy averages between developed and developing nations, bringing out disparities based on country status.
- **Health Indicators (BMI and Mortality)**: Connects average life expectancy with BMI and mortality rates across countries to highlight potential correlations.
- **Rolling Adult Mortality**: Calculates the cumulative adult mortality over time for countries containing "United" in their name, providing insights into trends within these specific regions.

## Conclusion

This exploratory analysis reveals important factors influencing life expectancy globally. Insights from GDP, BMI, and other socio-economic and health metrics offer a deeper understanding of the disparities in life expectancy across countries, highlighting areas for further research and policy consideration.

## Requirements

To run these SQL queries, a basic understanding of SQL and access to a database management system with the `world_life_expectancy` data table are required.
